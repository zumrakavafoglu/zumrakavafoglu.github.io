    <h4>Course Description</h4>
    This course serves as an introduction to the fundamentals of computer science and programming. It aims to help students with little or no programming experience to gain necessary skills to work with abstract notions for solving computational problems. The course is structured around basic topics such as control flow, functions, lists, input and output, simple data structures (sets, dictionaries), testing and debugging, recursion and pointers. The class will use the Python and C programming languages as a medium to provide a basic understanding of basic concepts in computer science, and the students will gain hand-on experience via a set of programming assignments supplied in the complementary BBM 103 Introduction to Programming Practicum.

        I'm a former assistant professor at Hacettepe University Institute of Informatics, Computer Graphics Department. Recently, I left my position at the university due to relocating to London. I received my M.Sc and Ph.D. degrees from Hacettepe University Department of Mathematics, by conducting interdisciplinary research studies covering Computer Science topics. During my Ph.D, I worked as a visiting researcher at Utrecht University(Netherlands), Department of Information and Computing Sciences. My current research interests consist of computer graphics and animation, especially physics-based and data-driven human animation as well as  machine learning and optimization methods for computer animation.     </p>

In this TUBITAK project, a software called *NetPro/Mine* has been developed which can perform all stages of ore body modeling and mine planning. It provides tools for data input, 3D visualization and digitization, digital terrain model (DTM) construction, geological solid modeling, block modeling, classical and geostatistical resource and reserve estimation, mine design and planning.
In this project, i worked as both researcher and programmer in the development of 3d modelling and visualization components of the software like triangulation of ore cross sections in any direction, construction of solid models from cross sections and clipping an inner part of the ore body by a given projectional polygon.

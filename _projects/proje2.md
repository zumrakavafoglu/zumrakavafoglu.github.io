This TUBITAK project covers research on physics based character animation, human motion database creation and retrieval, motion classification and segmentation and motion retargeting to non-humanoid characters. In this project I worked as a researcher in building high level physics based controllers for walking, climbing and catching motions. Within the project a free motion capture database named MIDAS has been generated.
